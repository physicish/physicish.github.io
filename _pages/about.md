I am an N3AS Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, and a Visiting Scholar at Northwestern University’s Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA). I study the universe through gravitational waves, using both simulations and observations to explore cosmology, the nature of neutron stars, tests of general relativity, and the promise of next-generation detectors.

I earned my PhD in Physics from the Pennsylvania State University in August 2025, supervised by <a href="https://igc.psu.edu/people/bio/bss25/">Prof. B. Sathyaprakash</a>, and received the <a href="https://science.psu.edu/news/three-eberly-graduate-students-honored-research-and-excellence-awards-0">Penn State Alumni Association Dissertation Award</a> for my doctoral research.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
